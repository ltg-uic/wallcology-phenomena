WallCology Phenomena
====================
WallCology is a computer simulation designed to support elementary and middle 
school curricular goals in life science and population ecology. 
WallCology situates students within a complex virtual ecosystem, where they may 
conduct investigations focusing on topics such as the identification and 
classification of species, habitat selection, population estimation, food 
chains, predator-prey relationships, life cycle phases, adaptation, and response 
to environmental change.
